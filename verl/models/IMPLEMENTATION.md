# Gemma3 and Mistral Model Implementation

This document describes the implementation of Gemma3 and Mistral models in the VERL framework, following the instructions in `verl/models/README.md`.

## Overview of Changes

We have successfully integrated the Gemma3 and Mistral models into the VERL framework. The key changes include:

1. Updating the existing model files to better support the original models:
   - `verl/models/gemma3/megatron/modeling_gemma3_megatron.py`
   - `verl/models/mistral/megatron/modeling_mistral_megatron.py`

2. Creating packed input adapters for both models:
   - `verl/models/gemma3/megatron/modeling_gemma_packed.py`
   - `verl/models/mistral/megatron/modeling_mistral_packed.py`

3. Adding test files to verify the implementation:
   - `verl/models/tests/test_gemma3_packed.py`
   - `verl/models/tests/test_mistral_packed.py`

## Implementation Details

### Step 1: Copied Original Model Files

The original model files were copied from Hugging Face's Transformers library to:
- `verl/models/gemma3/megatron/modeling_gemma_original.py`
- `verl/models/mistral/megatron/modeling_mistral_original.py`

### Step 2: Modified Models for Packed Inputs

Following the README instructions, we:

1. Removed code related to inference (KV cache):
   - The packed model implementation doesn't use KV cache for inference
   - Attention mask handling is done via cu_seqlens instead

2. Modified inputs to include only:
   - `input_ids` (total_nnz,)
   - `cu_seqlens` (total_nnz + 1,)
   - `max_seqlen_in_batch`: int

3. Implemented Flash Attention support with causal mask:
   - The packed models use Flash Attention for efficient processing
   - Causal masking is handled automatically by Flash Attention

### Step 2.5: Added Tests

Created test files to compare the original and packed implementations:
- Verified that weights are correctly copied from original to packed models
- Tested that both models produce equivalent outputs for the same input data
- Handles reshaping packed outputs to compare with original model outputs

### Step 3: Applied Tensor Parallelism

Added support for tensor parallelism following PyTorch's native approach:
- Updated the Megatron wrapper models to use PyTorch's tensor parallelism
- Configured tensor parallelism for attention and feed-forward layers
- Added appropriate configuration parameters like `use_positional_embedding` and `rotary_base`

### Step 4: Added Support for Data Parallelism

Prepared models for FSDP2 (Fully Sharded Data Parallelism):
- Modified the models to work with PyTorch's FSDP2 APIs
- The `get_parallel_gptmodel_from_config` function includes support for data parallelism
- Ensured proper sharing of embedding weights when `tie_word_embeddings` is enabled

### Step 5: Considered Pipeline Parallelism

Added basic support for pipeline parallelism with appropriate model segmentation:
- Created separate classes for different pipeline configurations (`ParallelGemma3ForCausalLMRmPadPP` and `ParallelMistralForCausalLMRmPadPP`)
- Properly segregated layers for pipeline parallel processing
- Prepared for Pytorch 2.4's pipeline parallelism features

## Improvements Made

1. **Enhanced Input Processing**: Added support for both packed inputs and traditional batched inputs.
2. **Rotary Embeddings**: Improved handling of position embeddings for rotary attention.
3. **Sliding Window Support**: Enhanced Mistral's sliding window attention mechanism to work with packed inputs.
4. **Weight Conversion**: Added utility functions to convert between original and packed model weights.
5. **Better Parameter Configuration**: Added model-specific parameters to the `TransformerConfig` objects.

## Shortcomings Addressed

1. **Missing Packed Input Support**: The original implementation lacked proper support for packed sequences.
2. **Limited Flash Attention Integration**: Improved Flash Attention integration for packed inputs.
3. **Incomplete RoPE Implementation**: Enhanced rotary embeddings for better performance with packed inputs.
4. **Missing Tensor Parallelism Config**: Added proper tensor parallelism configuration.
5. **Missing Gemma3-Specific Parameters**: Added missing parameters like `use_scaled_init` and `rotary_base`.

## Usage

To use these models, you can:

1. Load the original Hugging Face models
2. Convert them to packed models using the utility functions
3. Use them with PyTorch's tensor/pipeline parallelism for efficient scaling

```python
from transformers import Gemma3Config, MistralConfig
from verl.models.gemma3.megatron.modeling_gemma_original import Gemma3ForCausalLM
from verl.models.gemma3.megatron.modeling_gemma_packed import convert_gemma3_to_packed
from verl.models.mistral.megatron.modeling_mistral_original import MistralForCausalLM
from verl.models.mistral.megatron.modeling_mistral_packed import convert_mistral_to_packed

# Load original models
gemma_config = Gemma3Config.from_pretrained("google/gemma-7b")
mistral_config = MistralConfig.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1")

gemma_model = Gemma3ForCausalLM.from_pretrained("google/gemma-7b")
mistral_model = MistralForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1")

# Convert to packed models
gemma_packed = convert_gemma3_to_packed(gemma_model, gemma_config)
mistral_packed = convert_mistral_to_packed(mistral_model, mistral_config)

# Use with tensor parallelism and packed inputs
# ...
